# Miscellaneous

This repo contains misc. *helper functions* I use in different **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** projects. Some might work, others might not...

## Usage
Usage is normally by appending the module location to sys.path and then importing, eg. :  

```
import sys
sys.path.append('/bph/puredata1/bioinfdata/user/butjos/work/code/misc')

import misc
```
